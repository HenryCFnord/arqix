## Requirement

The arqix CLI SHALL support Pandoc `--defaults` files and the eisvogel template option when configured.

### Notes

Derived from the acceptance criteria of US-04-01-03, US-06-01-05 under the canonical-owner model (see `docs/en/plans/requirements-derivation-2026-07-02/PLANS.md`, decision 10).
Cross-cutting behaviour is linked via the stories' `has-requirement`, not restated here.
